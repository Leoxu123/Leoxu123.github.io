Hello! Welcome to my blog! Hope it hasn't waste your time.

I am Jian Xu and studying for my master degree at USTC now. I feel hot for many things, watching anime(Japan comic), playing basketball and computer games, painting(a skill I want to grasp), and reading.

##My research field now include:

* Natural Language Processing(mainly focus on word, text representation).
* Machine Learning(mainly focus on Deeping Learning).
* computer graphics(outclass hobby) 

If you want to talk something on them, feel free to contact me at jianxu1@mail.ustc.edu.cn
